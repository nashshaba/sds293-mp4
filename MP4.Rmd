```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load all your packages here:
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(rpart)
library(yardstick)

# Set default behavior for all code chunks here:
knitr::opts_chunk$set(

)

# Set seed value of random number generator here. This is in order to get
# "replicable" randomness, so that any results based on random sampling or
# resampling are replicable everytime you knit this file. Why use a seed value
# of 76? For no other reason than 76 is one of my favorite numbers:

You will be fitting CART models to the data from the [Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/){target="_blank"} Kaggle competition. The competition's score for leaderboard purposes is the "Categorization Accuracy". However you will **NOT** be making any submissions to Kaggle.

# Load data

Read in data provided by Kaggle for this competition. They are organized in the `data/` folder of this RStudio project:

```{r}
training <- read_csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")
sample_submission <- read_csv("data/sample_submission.csv")
```


## Look at your data!

Always, ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** start by looking at your raw data. This gives you visual sense of what information you have to help build your predictive models. To get a full description of each variable, read the data dictionary in the `data_description.txt` file in the `data/` folder.

Note that the following code chunk has `eval = FALSE` meaning "don't evaluate this chunk with knitting" because `.Rmd` files won't knit if they include a `View()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(training)
glimpse(training)

View(test)
glimpse(test)
```

In particular, pay close attention to the variables and variable types in the
`sample_submission.csv`. Your submission must match this exactly.

```{r}
glimpse(sample_submission)
```

# Minimally viable product

Perform the following exploratory data analyses:

## Univariate explorations

**Categorical predictor**: Create a visualization of the categorical predictor variable `color`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=training,aes(x=color, fill=color))+
  geom_bar(color="grey1",show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(title="Distributuion of the categorical predictor variable", x="Dominant Color of the Creature") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey1", "darkred", "blue","snow2","lawngreen","ghostwhite"))
```


**Outcome variable**: Create a visualization of the categorical predictor variable `type`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=training,aes(x=type))+
  geom_bar(fill="bisque4")+
  labs(title="Distributuion of the categorical outcome variable", x="Creature Type")
```


## Mutlivariate explorations

**Numerical predictors**: Create a visualization of the relationship of all four numerical predictor variables at once (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`) using the `ggpairs()` function from the `GGally` [package](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/#ggallyggpairs). 

```{r}
plot <- ggpairs(training, columns = c("bone_length", "rotting_flesh", "hair_length","has_soul"), columnLabels = c("Avg bone length", "% of rotting flesh", "Avg hair length","% of soul"))+
  labs(title = "Relationship between all four numerical predictor variables")

plot
```

**Relationship of categorical predictor and outcome variable**: Create a visualization of the relationship between the categorical outcome variable `type` and any predictor varible of your choosing.

```{r}
ggplot(training, aes(x = color, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(fill = "Types of creature", title = "Distribution of color of creature split by creature type", y="Proportion") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=training,aes(x=type, y=rotting_flesh))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Creature Type", y="% of rotting flesh in the creature",title = "Distribution of percentage of rotting flesh split by type of creature") 
```

# Due diligence

1. Fit a CART where:
    * You use only the numerical predictors.
    * The maximum depth of the tree is 5.
    * You use the default "complexity parameter" 
1. Plot the tree.
1. Make predictions `type_hat` on the `training` data. Hint compare the output of `predict(model_CART, type = "prob")` and `predict(model_CART, type = "class")`.
1. Compute the "classification accuracy".

```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width=16}

# Fit CART model, in this case for classification
model_formula_1 <- as.formula(type ~ bone_length + rotting_flesh + hair_length + has_soul)
tree_parameters_1 <- rpart.control(maxdepth = 5)
model_CART_1 <- rpart(model_formula_1, data = training, control = tree_parameters_1)

# Plot CART model
plot(model_CART_1, margin=0.25)
text(model_CART_1, use.n = TRUE)

title("Predicting type of creature using bone length,% of rotting flesh, hair length, & % of soul")
box()

# Get fitted probabilities for each class on train
type_hat_prob <- model_CART_1 %>%
  predict(type = "prob", newdata = training) %>%
  # Convert matrix object to data frame:
  as_tibble()

glimpse(type_hat_prob)

type_hat_class <- model_CART_1 %>%
  predict(type = "class", newdata = test) %>%
  # Convert matrix object to data frame:
  as_tibble()

glimpse(type_hat_class)

bind_cols(
  # Observed y:
  type = as.factor(training$type),
  # Fitted probabilities for each class
  type_hat_prob
) %>%
# Compute multi-class log-loss
mn_log_loss(truth = type, c(Ghost, Ghoul, Goblin))
```

# Reaching for the stars

Note that the $\alpha$ complexity parameter is the `cp` argument to `rpart.control()`.

1. Reusing the MP1 solutions code, for the range of `alpha` complexity parameters in the `alpha_df` data frame, return an estimate of the accuracy/error that Kaggle would return.
1. Plot the relationship between the alpha complexity parameter and accuracy.
1. Using the optimal $\alpha^*$ complexity parameter, write a `submission.csv` suitable for submission to Kaggle.


```{r}
set.seed(76)

training <- training %>% 
  sample_frac(1) %>% 
  mutate(fold = rep(1:5, length = n())) %>% 
  arrange(fold)

alpha_df <- tibble(
  alpha = seq(from = 0, to = 0.05, length = 100),
  accuracy = 0
)

for(i in 1:nrow(alpha_df)){
  alpha <- alpha_df$alpha[i]
  
  CA <- rep(0, 5)
  for(j in 1:5){
    pretend_training <- training %>% 
      filter(fold != j)
    pretend_test <- training %>% 
      filter(fold == j)
    
    # Fit model on pretend training
    model_1 <- as.formula(type ~ bone_length + rotting_flesh + hair_length + has_soul)
    tree_parameters <- rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = alpha)
    model_CART <- rpart(model_1, data = pretend_training, control = tree_parameters)
    
    # Make predictions
    predicted_pretend_test <- model_CART %>%
    predict(type = "class", newdata = pretend_test)
    
    pretend_test<-pretend_test%>%
      mutate(y_hat = predicted_pretend_test)
    
    
    # Save predictions in pretend_test data frame
    
    CA[j] <- pretend_test %>%
      mutate(truth=ifelse(type==y_hat, 1, 0))%>%
      summarise(CA = mean(truth==1))%>%
      pull(CA)
  }
  
  alpha_df$accuracy[i] <- mean(CA)
}
```

#Visualization
```{r}
ggplot(alpha_df, aes(x = alpha, y = accuracy)) +
  geom_line()
```

# Point of diminishing returns

* Use one-hot-enconding to fit a predictive CART model using the categorical variable `color` and plot the tree. Set the maximum depth of the tree to 5 and use the default "complexity parameter".
* No need to generate an estimate of the accuracy that Kaggle would return.
